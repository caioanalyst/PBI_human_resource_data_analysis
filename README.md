# PBI_human_resource_data_analysis

 The purpose of this project is to extract information about resource human data. This project was developed in a Data Science Academy course: https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br

 The questions below must be answered:

1- What is the total number of employees currently in the company?

2- What is the average length of experience of employees (in years)?

3- What is the total and percentage of male and female employees?

4- What is the average monthly salary?

5- What is the total number of employees per function?

6- What is the percentage of employees available to work overtime?

7- What is the level of employee involvement at work considering 4 categories: Bad, Low, Medium and High?

8- This item should not be on the Dashboard, but it needs to be calculated: What is the total and percentage of employees that should receive a promotion? Consider the column “Years Since Last Promotion” with the following rule: If the employee has been 5 years or more since the last promotion, he must have the promotion considered. Otherwise, the promotion should not be considered now.
